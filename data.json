For example, I have a hash of words and respective frequencies that I want to order by frequency.\n\nThere is a SortedList which is good for a single value (say frequency), that I want to map back to the word.\n\nSortedDictionary orders by key, not value. Some resort to a custom class, but is there a cleaner way?",
